- 👋 Hi, I’m @jstehli
- 👀 I’m interested in that weird thing between business and tech (mainly data intensive applications) and how to generate value from data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that seems interesting to me. Mainly in Python, I guess.
- 📫 How to reach me: hi (at) jsteh (dot) li
